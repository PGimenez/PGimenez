I am a PhD electrical engineer with extensive experience in machine learning, scientific programming, web development, and cloud development. Always striving to solve complex problems using cutting-edge technologies, my goal is to help data scientists and researchers bring their algorithms and models to production.

I'm the developer advocate at [Genie](https://genieframework.com). Check out the [App Gallery](https://learn.genieframework.com/app-gallery) to see the webapps I've built with Genie Framework.

I'm also working on some personal projects:
- [Carryall](https://carryall.io): a self-hosted platform to deploy applications and run workflows on Kubernetes.
- [Surge](https://github.com/sciflydev/Surge.jl): a package that exposes reactive state via WebSockets, enabling real-time synchronization between Julia backends and web clients. See a [running demo](https://iris.carryall.app/) with a VueJS frontend.
- [StateSignals](https://github.com/sciflydev/StateSignals.jl): a reactive graph-based state management system where values automatically update based on their dependencies.
- [WeatherForecast](https://github.com/PGimenez/WeatherForecast): a ML pipeline for weather forecasting running on Kubernetes.
